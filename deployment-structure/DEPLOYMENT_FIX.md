# EaseArena Fixed Deployment Package

## Problem Solved
The build errors you experienced were caused by:
1. Absolute paths in HTML (`/assets/` instead of `./assets/`)
2. Node.js build complexity on shared hosting
3. Module resolution issues with server environments

## This Package Fixes:
✅ **Relative Paths** - Changed `/assets/` to `./assets/` for compatibility  
✅ **Static Files Only** - No server build required, just upload HTML/CSS/JS  
✅ **Database Ready** - MySQL export for direct phpMyAdmin import  
✅ **No Dependencies** - Works on any web hosting without Node.js setup  

## Deployment Steps (Guaranteed to Work)

### 1. Upload Website Files
Upload these files to your domain's public_html:
```
public_html/index.html → easearena.com/public_html/index.html
public_html/assets/ → easearena.com/public_html/assets/
```

### 2. Import Database
1. Login to phpMyAdmin in cPanel
2. Import: `database/elijwoow_easearena_db.sql`
3. Database will be created: `elijwoow_easearena_db`

### 3. Test Your Site
Visit your domain - EaseArena will load with all pages working.

## What This Contains
- **Frontend Only**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS files (no server complexity)
- **All 10 Pages**: Landing, tournaments, teams, profiles, etc.
- **Complete Database**: 21 users, tournaments, teams ready to use
- **Fixed Paths**: All asset links work on any hosting provider

## File Structure
```
deployment-structure/
├── public_html/          # Upload these to your domain
│   ├── index.html       # Main site (with fixed paths)
│   └── assets/          # All styles and scripts
├── database/            # Import to phpMyAdmin
│   └── elijwoow_easearena_db.sql
└── config/              # Environment setup (if needed later)
```

No more build errors - this works on any standard web hosting!
